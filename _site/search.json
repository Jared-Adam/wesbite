    "text": "About Me\nAt present, my master’s thesis is broadly focused on Integrated Pest Management within conventional row crops. Some of my current research interests and directions include, but are not limited to, studying the influences true spiders have in the realm of biological control in conventional row crops as well as assessing agroecosystem quality using microarthropods as biological indicators. The most notable project I currently work on is called the Common Experiment 2 (CE2) which is presently funded by a Precision Sustainable Agriculture grant through the USDA. The focus of this project is pest management of insects, weeds, and disease within conventional corn production and includes 16 collaborating Universities spanning the Eastern to Midwestern US from Texas to Vermont. Within this project, my responsibilities include, but are not limited to, serving as the immediate contact for protocol/ entomology-based questions, managing the data flow and analyses for all entomology-related data from all collaborators, and working with the other project leads on the synthesis of each respective discipline."

    "text": "My philosophy of education is facilitating a classroom experience that ensures the success of all students. Everyone comes from diverse backgrounds comprising both personal and professional experiences. These experiences allow students to bring boundless prior insight and knowledge to their undergraduate and graduate education, including cognitive modes. It is my desire to promote a classroom that ensures no matter the learning style, students can not only succeed, but fail and learn with one another. Through real-world problems and examples, students will be challenged to use new and prior knowledge to critically think and evaluate different subject matter.\nThrough hands-on opportunities and peer led learning activities, students will be able to work through active critical thinking as well as gain experience in disseminating information, which ultimately will allow them to understand the subject matter more effectively. I will also task students with reflections to ensure that each student is supported and has their educational needs met in my classroom. Without feedback, I cannot confirm that my methods are working for each student; and if I am not supporting each individual student appropriately, then I am failing as an instructor.\nI aim to bring an open mind, good energy, and high expectations to each class. I will challenge students to escape their comfort zone and leave their pride at the door. I believe that you teach how you think best until you know better. By this, I mean I will adapt to my students’ needs and may very well change my philosophy over time. This is ok because learning is a lifelong process, and I will be learning from my students as they learn from me."
